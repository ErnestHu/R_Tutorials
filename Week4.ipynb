    "# Week 4: Data Frames\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we will discover Data Frames--the fundamental data structure to deal with data sets!\n",
    "\n",
    "A data frame is closely related to a list. In Layman terms, a data frame is a sub category of a list because it has multiple restrictions on how a data frame is defined; thus, it represents a list with the class, \"data.frame\". \n",
    "\n",
    "**Restrictions/Requirements for a Data Frame**\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Components must consist of vectors, factors, numeric matrices, lists, or other data frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Matrices, lists, and data frames provide as many variables to the new data frame as they have columns, elements, or variables, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Numeric vectors, logicals, and factors are left alone. Character vectors are coerced to be factors, whose levels are the unique values appearing in the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) If you are adding vector structures to the data frame, it is important to note that *all vector structures* must be the SAME LENGTH! Similarly, *matrix structures* must all have the SAME ROW SIZE. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why not use a matrix? Isn't this what a data frame basically is?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Not necessarily! The main reason a data frame is so useful to manipulate datasets is to include numerics, characters, and other classes of objects. You may ask why not use a matrix. That's because a matrix does not have the versatility of a data frame in the sense that it can only hold *numbers*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** \n",
    "A data frame may for many purposes be regarded as a matrix with columns possibly of\n",
    "differing modes and attributes. It may be displayed in matrix form, and its rows and columns\n",
    "extracted using matrix indexing conventions.\n",
