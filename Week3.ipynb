    "\n",
    "- Functions are what makes coding, *coding*. The primary purpose of a function is to manipulate the different objects created in R.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating your own functions will ultimately help you more efficiently accomplish tasks that would normally take you more time than you need to exhaust.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions act as an operator, just like basic arithmetic symbols (eg +, -, /). Functions have an input and an output. You call a function when you want to complete a task.\n",
