    "\n",
    "Transitioning into from the basics of R, we will now learn about lists, one of the crucial fundamentals in future data science endeavors./n\",\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists will open a gateway to group different objects, whether individually or in a vector, into a succinct bundle. This can be especially helpful when you want to compare differences in a neat format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Review of Vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each vector will be comprised of either characters, numerics, integers, boolean, or complex objects. They will follow the syntax below...\n",
    "\n",
    "==> 'vector_variable' <- c('list of objects')\n",
    "\n",
    "- character ... <code> dms <- c(\"s\", \"e\", \"n\", \"d\", \"n\", \"u\") </code>\n",
    "- numeric ..... <code> int <- c(1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 5.5, 8.8) </code>\n",
    "- integer ..... <code> num <- c(1, 2, 3, 5) </code>\n",
    "- boolean ..... <code> boo <- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F) </code>\n",
    "- complex ..... <code> cpx <- c(3 + i, -1 + 3i) </code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how dms has 6 elements, int has 5 elements, num has 4 elements, boo has 4 elements, and cpx has 2 elements.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Lists: \"Bundling\" Vectors\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When you hear the word list, one may think of a group of individual components in a vector-like form, like a grocery list! In the most rudimentary sense, a \"list\" in the context of the R programming language is actually a \"list of lists\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "Each list will follow the format \n",
    "==> *list_variable* <- list(*vector_1*, *vector_2*, *vector_3*)\n",

    "(input)  ==> <code> bundle <- list(dms, int, num, boo, cpx) </code>\n",

    "                    [[1]]\n",

    "                    [[2]]\n",
    "                    [1] 1.1 2.2 3.3 5.5 8.8\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: By deduction, you can see that dms corresponds to [[1]], int to [[2]], and etc. Also if you notice, there are number in single square brackets and numbers in double square brackets. The single brackets indicate vectors, matrices, arrays, and data frames (all of which are either 1D vectors or 2D squares). The double brackets indicate subscripts on lists.\n",
