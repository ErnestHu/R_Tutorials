**Topics**: This class will cover the basics of the R programming language and apply the material to real-world problems and data. In the first weeks, we will explore the fundamentals and syntax of R. Next, we will learn how to load and format data. In the last weeks we will cover the basics of [ggplot2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ggplot2), a popular data visualization package for R.

**Textbooks and other resources**: While none are required, the following are all great resources for anyone learning the R language.
- [Jupyter Notebook Docs](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has all the answers for installing, running, and saving Jupyter Notebooks
- [DataCamp.com](https://www.datacamp.com/courses?learn=r_programming) is an interactive programming tutorial website (much like Codecademy)
- [The R Book](https://www.cs.upc.edu/~robert/teaching/estadistica/TheRBook.pdf) is a great R reference manual
- [PSTAT's Piazza Group](https://piazza.com/ucsb/other/pstat199) is where students can ask and answer R programming questions
